Function

   Extracts conserved oligomers per position using Z-score

Description

   This function calculates and extracts conserved oligomers per position using
   Z-score, in regions around the start/stop codons. The oligomers are returned
   in ranking order up to "-limit" number.

   The Z-score for mean m and standard error SE is calculated as follows:
   z = (x - m) / SE
   where SE for standard deviation s and number of samples s is as follows:
   SE = s/sqrt(n)
