                              gbaserelativeentropy
Function

   Calculates and graphs the sequence conservation using Kullback-Leibler

Description

   This function calculates and graphs the sequence conservation in regions
   around the start/stop codons using Kullback-Leibler divergence (relative
   entropy). In realistic conditions, as background nucleotide composition
   (e.g. G+C content) varies among species. Kullback-Leibler divergence
   calculates the entropy with reduced background noise.

   The relative entropy H at position i with distribution P(i) is calculated
   as follows:
   H(P(i)||pi) = sum(P(i,j) * log(2, P(i,j)/pi(j)))
