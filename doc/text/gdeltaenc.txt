Function

   Calculate the codon usage bias related to translation optimization
   (delta ENC)

Description

   gdeltaenc calculates the codon usage bias related to translation
   optimization (delta ENC) described in Rocha (2004). The basic idea is to
   calculate the Effective Number of Codons (ENC) for highly-expressed genes
   (ribosomal genes) and weakly-expressed genes (all genes), and taking the
   relative difference between them. ENC assigns a gene a number between 20 to
   61 where 20 indicates that one codon is used for each aminoacid and 61
   indicates that each codon is used equally throughout the protein sequence.

   ENC is calculated as follows:
