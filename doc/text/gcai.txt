Function

   Calculate codon adaptation index for each gene

Description

   gcai calculates codon adaptation index (CAI) for each gene. CAI is measure
   a of the relative adaptiveness of the codon usage of a gene towards the
   codon usage of highly expressed genes, ranging from 0 (no bias) to 1
   (maximum bias). CAI can be used as a 'universal' measure of codon usage
   bias as it is correlated with various gene features such as gene expression
   level, GC content, and GC skew.

   The CAI for a gene where A(i) is the amino acid at position i and W(A) is
   the W value corresponding to the amino acid is calculated as follows:

   CAI = sum(log(e,W(A(i))))
